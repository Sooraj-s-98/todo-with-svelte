We need to make a few configuration changes to your Appwrite server.

1. Add a new Web App in Appwrite and enter the endpoint of your website (localhost, <project-name>.vercel.app etc)

## üé¨ Getting Started

### ü§ò Install Appwrite 
Follow our simple [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice. 

> Note: If you setup Appwrite on your local machine, you will need to create a public IP so that your hosted frontend can access it.

Follow these instructions to run the demo app locally

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Sooraj-s-98/todo-with-svelte
$ cd todo-with-svelte
